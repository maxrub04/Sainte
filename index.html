        <div class="red">Sainté’s music makes his hometown of Leicester feel like the centre of the universe.

          Famous for its multi-ethnic population, Leicester City Football Club, and for being the first major city in the UK to have its own local radio station—BBC Radio Leicester, launched back in 1967—it’s pretty much bound into scripture that Leicester would conjure up a talent like Sainté.
        </div>
       <div class="red big">Since dropping his debut single, “Envy Me”, in 2019, Sainté’s name has been bubbling behind the scenes, and today he stands as one of UK rap’s brightest prospects. Grabbing more attention with his Local MVP project at the top of the year, the rapper walked the relentless balance beam that is quantity versus quality. Seemingly managing both with ease, the 21-year-old bagged his first viral hit with “Champagne Shots”. Imbued with a fluid yet frank delivery, Sainté builds a musical prism weighted in duality; somewhere in-between the cocky one-liners and lyrical diary entries lies the nucleus of his creative driving force. </div>
       
       <div class="red big">While it’s all too commonplace to call every artist unique, Sainté’s music radiates standalone energy. He has less in common with his UK drill and trap contemporaries and more similarities with cloudy Stateside rappers like Dom Kennedy or Isaiah Rashad. Everything from the Dave Meyers and Hype Williams-inspired visuals for “No Love” to his carefully curated wardrobe—a futureproof take on what you’d see in an old issue of The Source or XXL Magazine—Sainté is stepping different to everybody else in today’s UK music scene. </div>
